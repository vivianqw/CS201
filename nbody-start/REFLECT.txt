Impressions: As the first assignment, it is pretty difficult for people who have not programmed in java before, but not too bad for people who
had some kind of experience in java. It went smoothly when I was programming the Body class (that calculates everything) probably because I am more used to write 
codes in MATLAB that mainly serves as calculation tools. When I was programming in NBody, I began to get errors when I was trying to load the txt file
into the body array. After realizing that I did not declare a body array before the loop starts, I corrected the error, and everything worked out eventually.

Question 1: What is the final position of the planets after 1,000,000 and 
2,000,000 seconds with a timestep of 25,000 using planets.txt?
After 1000000 seconds: 
x position   y position  planet
 1.4657e+11  2.9604e+10  earth
 2.2659e+11  2.4055e+10  mars
 3.8636e+10  4.2569e+10  mercury
 2.6827e+04  2.9792e+03  sun
 1.0244e+11  3.4391e+10  venus
 After 2000000 seconds: 
 x position	  y position  planet
  1.3774e+11  5.8036e+10  earth
 2.2275e+11  4.7841e+10   mars
-5.9865e+09  5.7090e+10   mercury
 1.0223e+05  2.3000e+04   sun
 8.5997e+10  6.5196e+10   venus

Question 2: For what values of timeStep, does the simulation no longer behave correctly? 
When total time is 10^9 and dt is 10^6, the simulation is no longer behaving correctly. The planet closest to sun (mercury in this case) will fly out 
of the circular orbit it was in (with the sun as the center of the circle) and travel in an elliptical pattern. It can even travel to a place farther 
from the sun than mars! Such inaccuracy occurs because the position of the body determines the direction and magnitude of the net force acting on it, 
which determines the direction and magnitude of the acceleration. If the dt is too large, the body will experience the same acceleration vector over 
a long period of time even if the acceleration were to be changed because of the object's displacement. Thus a large dt will result in incorrect behavior.
